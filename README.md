This program is made to use classes and user information to print user-vehicle information.

This Python program was designed to use classes to define a vehicle's type and attributes.  There was a bug that kept preventing the program from running.  At this time, the issue is saying that  "vehicle_specs" does not have arguments for the attributes listed.  This is an example of a program gone wrong.  Feedback is appreciated.

Worked out the syntax for the vehicle classes to be able to accept user-input for vehicle_type, year, make, and model.  Was able to print out statements to the user. The logic could be better, especially when printing out the final statements, and could have used a counter to have user re-enter the information if it was incorrectly entered.  For now, I am happy that the program ran without errors, but as always, I welcome feedback.  ~T. Barlow (SDEV 220 Student) | Instructor: C. Francis
