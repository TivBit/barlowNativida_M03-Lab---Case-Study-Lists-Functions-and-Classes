This program is made to use classes and user information to print user-vehicle information.

This Python program was designed to use classes to define a vehicle's type and attributes.  There was a bug that kept preventing the program from running.  At this time, the issue is saying that  "vehicle_specs" does not have arguments for the attributes listed.  This is an example of a program gone wrong.  Feedback is appreciated.
